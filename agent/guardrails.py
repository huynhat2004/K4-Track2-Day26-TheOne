"""agent/guardrails.py — the safety checks a defending answer should pass
before it is ever submitted as an ANSWER action.

WHERE THIS FILE FITS (read this before wondering why `Gateway.decide` never
calls anything here): `Gateway.decide` (agent/gateway.py) only ever sees
MCP/A2A/DISCOVER *commands* — an ANSWER action never becomes a `Command`
at all (kit/loop/agent.py's own module docstring says so explicitly), so
your gateway's control plane structurally CANNOT be where an answer gets
checked. The functions below are meant to run over the ANSWER your model
is about to submit and the anchors it actually retrieved this exchange —
wire them into whatever assembles that final ANSWER action (your own
wrapper around `kit.loop.Agent`, or a check you run in your own tests
before trusting a transcript). `agent/README.md`'s table names exactly
which of the 17 rubric classes each function below stands between you and.

IMPLEMENTED CHECKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`check_grounding` validates anchor syntax and proves every citation was
retrieved in the current exchange. `scan_for_injected_instructions` uses a
high-signal instruction/authority pattern set, `redact` removes common secret
and learner-private values, and `verify_arithmetic` requires every numeric
claim to appear in supplied supporting text. `abstention_policy` remains the
simple safe floor: abstain whenever grounding fails.

Stdlib only. No network, no randomness, no wall-clock reads.

    """"Every claim traces to a returned anchor" (this task's own brief),
    made concrete: every string in `answer["cited_anchors"]` must (a) parse
    as valid `ns:slug[/rev][/idx][#span]` syntax (`kit.world.anchor.Anchor`)
    and (b) be a member of `retrieved_anchors` — the anchors YOUR exchange
    actually got back from a `tool_result` this round, not anchors you
    recognise from having seen them before, and not anchors you are
    inferring exist.

    `retrieved_anchors` is YOUR responsibility to assemble honestly — the
    right source is the union of every `tool_result.anchors` your agent
    received this exchange (CONTRACTS.md 5.2's `tool_result` event field),
    never something wider like "every anchor this world index contains".
    Passing a wider set than what you actually retrieved makes this
    function agree with citations that are `ungrounded` in the sense that
    actually matters (CONTRACTS.md 6.1's rubric class) even though this
    function would call them grounded.

    Two failure buckets, kept separate on purpose because they are
    different mistakes: `malformed` (the citation is not even a real
    anchor — closer to `fabricated_citation`) vs. `ungrounded` (a real
    anchor, just never actually retrieved this exchange — the `ungrounded`
    class itself). `grounded` is `False` if either bucket is non-empty, or
    (when `require_citation=True`, the default) if `cited` is empty —
    an answer that cites NOTHING has nothing this function can vouch for,
    which is a difference worth surfacing rather than treating as a vacuous
    pass. Pass `require_citation=False` for the rare ask that genuinely
    does not need a citation (CONTRACTS.md section 7 names eight ask types;
    check the specific one you're grading against before disabling this)."""
